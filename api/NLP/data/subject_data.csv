1,"What is Quality? Quality is often measured in terms of conformance to requirements. A quality process or product conforms to its requirements. Conformance to requirements (Philip Crosby) Producer view Doing the right thing Doing it the right way Doing it right the first time Doing it on time without exceeding cost Fit for use (Joseph Juran & Edwards Deming) Customer view Receiving the right product for their use Being satisfied that their needs have been met Meeting their expectations Being treated with integrity, courtesy and respect Two Quality Gaps Producer View of Quality as Specified Producer Gap Producer View of Quality as Delivered Customer View of Quality as Wanted",Software Quality Assurance
2,"Specification-Based Test Case Design Techniques Equivalence partitioning Boundary value analysis Decision table Discovering what claims are made in the specifications and testing the product against them. Only concentrates on what the software does, not how it does it. Do not require the knowledge of how the system or component is structured. Also known as Behavior Based Testing and Black Box Testing. Uses the specification of the program as the point of reference for test data selection and adequacy. A specification can be anything like a written document, collection of use cases, a set of models, or a prototype.

3,"Software Quality Assurance Code Coverage Analysis - I Code Coverage Methods Statement Coverage Decision Coverage Branch Coverage Path Coverage Condition Coverage Multiple Condition Coverage Code coverage is a term used in software testing to describe how much program source code is covered by a testing plan. Developers look at the number of program subroutines and lines of code that are covered by a set of testing resources and techniques. Code coverage is also known as test coverage. Code coverage analysis can provide reassurance that programs are broadly tested for bugs and relatively error-free. Code coverage analysis is done mostly to find the precise areas that are not covered by testing strategies. Code coverage analysis and other testing aspects in beta or other development rounds exposes bugs to a small test audience, rather than to millions of users when products finally go live. Microsoft Visual Studio have specific menu tools for doing code coverage analysis.

E.g. :Automated Teller Machine (ATM) Primary goal of network design is to meet the organizations communication needs. Productivity Budget ",NETWORK DESIGN MANAGEMENT
5,"Audit Network Mapping Definition Goals Benefits Network mapping the OSI reference model Non network information Tools for performing network mapping In the good old days Baselinin Why? What? When? How?Audit Network management should start with an audit, Document/Map the entire network. Evaluate and baseline the physical and data link layer infrastructure. Evaluate and baseline network traffic and protocols. Evaluate and baseline platforms, operating systems and applications. Evaluate security Network Mapping Definition Network mapping in general is getting to know your network inside-out. Detailed description of everything Complex networks are difficult to visualize Big rewards Time consuming, boring!Network Mapping OSI Physical Layer Data Link Layer Network Layer Transport Layer Session Layer Presentation Layer Application LayerOSI model: Open Systems Interconnection model The OSI model defines a networking framework for implementing protocols in seven layers. Control is passed from one layer to the next, starting at the application layer in one station, proceeding to the bottom layer, over the channel to the next station and back up the hierarchy. Forouzan, TCP/IP Protocol Suite, Section 2.2 provides a concise description about OSI model. Following subsections are a summary or this reference. You are required to read this section of the book.",NETWORK DESIGN MANAGEMENT
6,"Definition of Network Monitoring Active vs. Passive monitoring Categories for monitoring Network specifications: Ethernet Network traffic and protocols Platforms and operating systems (next week lecture)A definition for Network Monitoring The term network monitoring describes the use of a system that constantly monitors a computer network for slow or failing components and that notifies the network administrator (via email, SMS or other alarms) in case of outages. It is a subset of the functions involved in network management. Monitoring an active communications network in order to diagnose problems and gather statistics for administration and fine tuning.What is Network Monitoring?? Write it in your terms.Types of Network Monitoring Two types of Network Monitoring Active Monitoring Passive Monitoring",NETWORK DESIGN MANAGEMENT
